# Intructions

Issues should only be raised for potential bugs and. If you have a question please ask on [stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), we are very active, just tag your question with 'typical-linguist', 'typescript' and 'collections-extension'

## What we need: 
* A clear discription of the problem
* Sample code 
* Stack traces if available
